2.) Download latest version of nerddinner from http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/ & decompress
3.) run MS Matrix, point it at the decompressed nerddinner directory & start.
->check the server name and port# nerd dinner is running on
->visit your tame nerd dinner site and verify things are working as expected
4.) Modify the selenium code in the Browser class to point at your local (verified working) nerd dinner site
