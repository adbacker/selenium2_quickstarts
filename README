Boise Code Camp 2012 - selenium 2 intro session
sample code
aaron backer


Project usess Scott Hansleman's nerd dinner app as a conveniant automation target

Easiest way to get it going: (assuming a windows host)

Download Microsoft Matrix - http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/ & install
Download latest version of nerddinner from http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/ & decompress
run MS Matrix, point it at the decompressed nerddinner directory & start.
->check the server name and port# nerd dinner is running on
->visit your tame nerd dinner site and verify things are working as expected
Modify the selenium code in the Browser class to point at your local (verified working) nerd dinner site

(note that to use selenium 2 grid, you'll need to set up that infrastructure separately)
